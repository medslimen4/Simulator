<h3>Title of the project:</h3>
Vehicle Tracking using IoT Hub

<h3>Description:</h3>
The Vehicle Tracking using IoT Hub project aims to develop a system for tracking vehicles in real-time using IoT technology. The system will consist of GPS-enabled devices installed in vehicles, which will transmit location data to an IoT Hub for processing and visualization. This data can then be accessed through a web-based dashboard, allowing users to monitor the location and movement of vehicles remotely.
Objectives
<h3>Objectives:</h3>
The main objective of this project is to create a robust and scalable vehicle tracking system using IoT technologies. It aims to provide accurate real-time location data for vehicles, improve fleet management efficiency, enhance security measures, and optimize route planning. Additionally, the system will support features such as geofencing, alerts for unauthorized vehicle usage, and historical tracking data analysis.
